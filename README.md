# About This Project

## The project simulates a banking situation and provides functionality including:
  - *login / authorization*
  - *new user registration*
  - *model validation*
  - *a console-portal*
  - *asynchronous thread handling*
  
 ### Please Note this is a work in progress! I have yet to complete validation, and I haven't started writing unit tests - but hopefully code-reviewers can see where I'm going with it and why.
